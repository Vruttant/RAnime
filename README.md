# RAnime

## What is RAnime?
Well RAnime is a simple random anime generator website. On a simple click you can get 6 completely random anime on your screen.
## What's the motivation behind it?
I was myself struggling to find anime so I went on the internet to find one webiste called animesuggest which was not working apparently hence I made this website. I'll be adding filters which will kind of make it less random but also give some control to the user.
## Things to do 
- Making AJAX partial view for the list which will prevent it from reloading the whole page.
- Enhancing the UI/UX of the site
- Add filters (as stated above)
## How to run?
Make sure you have latest stable version of Python, MSBuildTools (required for jinkanpy) and pip installed on your device after that execute the following commands after cding to the folder where this project is present.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

then you can simply do 

`python app.py`
